This README file pertails to the Peer Reviewed Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course offered by the John Hopkins University in their Data Science specialization. The main script is run_analysis.R which has been coded to do the following:

  1. Downloading the data if it does not already exist.
  2. Loading the activities and features.
  3. Loading the training and testing data.
  4. Loading the activities and subjects data.
  5. Merging the two datasets.
  6. Converting the activities and subjects into factors.
  7. Creating a tidy dataset which includes the mean value of each variable for each activity and subject pair.
  8. The end result is stored in the tidy.txt file.
